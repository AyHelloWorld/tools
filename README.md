## Introduction
These are various helper scripts that I use day to day.

## Description

 * config-all: used with ./configure, fills in all the prefix, lib, bin, sbin, man, info etc directories to point to a single install point
 * update-tags: updates ctags and cscope ; useful for emacs and vim code navigation
 * authadd: similar to ssh-copy-id but seems to work more.
 * ssh_config: Just a base level system with the control master settings that
 * strace-all: This will do a ps and grep for the string that is the last argument, then it will strace the pids of all of them simultaneously with parallelized xargs, following vforks
